# Recommended VSCode Extensions for Development

## Overview

This repository contains recommended VSCode extensions for different programming languages and frameworks. The structure is organized into four parent folders, each corresponding to a specific language or framework. Except for the JavaScript folder, all other folders contain a `.vscode` subfolder.

The idea is simple: clone this repository and copy the `.vscode` folder from the language or framework folder you are interested in, and paste it into your project's root directory. This will set up your VSCode environment with extensions that are tailored for that specific language or framework.
